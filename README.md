## Technical Accomplishments

* Utilized Ruby on Rails to manipulate an object-relational database of profiles that are randomly assigned to match with the user.
* Developed a series of custom methods to track and manage profile relationships, such as likes and resets.
* Implemented React.js hooks to dynamically respond to user inputs, creating card swiping functionality reminiscent to popular dating applications
